A library of functions to help with AWS management
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Functions related to a certain AWS service (EC2. S3, etc.) should be placed
in a module (file) with that service's name (ec2.py, s3.py, etc). The ones
that use several services should all go into a separate file.
